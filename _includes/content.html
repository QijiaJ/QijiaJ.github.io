<h2>Qijia Jiang</h2>
<p>Hello and Welcome! I am a final-year PhD student in Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a> advised by <a href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/">Emmanuel Candes</a>, with research interests in optimization, signal processing, statistics and decision making in social-dynamic environments. Earlier I spent four wonderful years at <a href="https://www.rice.edu/">Rice University</a>, graduated with two bachelor's (in Electrical Engineering + Statistics) with a minor in Applied Math in 2015 and a lovely summer at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">EPFL</a> before grad school.</p>

<h2>Teaching & Mentorship</h2>
I had fun TAing for Convex Optimization, Machine Learning classes in the past, and serving as a technical mentor for the Data Science for Social Good program at Stanford.
